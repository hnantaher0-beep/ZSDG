Perfect for velvet and vintage sofas.<br><br>Leather Sofa Restoration<br><br>Special cleaning creams are used to lift grime from leather, followed by conditioners that restore flexibility and shine. Cracking and fading are also prevented.<br><br>Shampooing<br><br>For sofas with stubborn stains and heavy usage, a high-foam shampoo is agitated into the fabric and removed using extraction methods.<br><br>UV Sanitization<br><br>Some companies now add UV sterilization as a final step—killing any remaining microbes without chemicals.<br><br>How Often Should You Book Sofa Cleaning?<br><br>The frequency depends on the usage and environment:<br><br>Every 6–8 months for standard households<br><br>Every 3–4 months if children or pets are present<br><br>Monthly or bi-monthly for offices, clinics, or hotels<br><br>After illness or seasonal changes to remove bacteria and allergens<br><br>Regular sofa cleaning in Dubai not only keeps your space fresh but also preserves the lifespan of your furniture.<br><br>What Are the Benefits?<br>1.
